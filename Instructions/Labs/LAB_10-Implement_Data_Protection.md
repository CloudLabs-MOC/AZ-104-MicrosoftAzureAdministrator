# Lab 10 - Implement Data Protection

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you learn about backup and recovery of Azure virtual machines. You learn to create a Recovery Service vault and a backup policy for Azure virtual machines. You learn about disaster recovery with Azure Site Recovery. 

## Interactive lab simulation

There is an interactive lab simulation that you might find useful for this topic. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required.

+ **[Backup virtual machines and on-premises files.](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-104%20Exam%20Guide%20-%20Microsoft%20Azure%20Administrator%20Exercise%2016)**. Create a recovery services vault and implement an Azure virtual machine backup. Implement on-premises file and folder backup using the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services agent. On-premises backups are outside the scope of this lab but it might be helpful to view those steps. 

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
+ Task 1: Use a template to provision an infrastructure.
+ Task 2: Create and configure a Recovery Services vault.
+ Task 3: Configure Azure virtual machine-level backup.
+ Task 4: Monitor Azure Backup.
+ Task 5: Enable virtual machine replication.  

## Excercise 1: Backup virtual machines

In this exercise, you will  learn how to configure and perform backups for Azure virtual machines using the Recovery Services Vault.

### Task 1: Provision the lab environment

In this task, you will deploy two virtual machines that will serve as test environments to explore and evaluate various backup scenarios.

1. In the Azure Portal page, in the **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)** box at the top of the portal search for **Deploy a custom template (1)** and select **Deploy a custom template (2)** resource.

1. On the edit template page, select **Load file** option  from the top navigation pane.

1. Locate and select the **C:\AllFiles\AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator-Lab-Files\Allfiles\Labs\10 (1)** then select **az104-10-vms-edge-template.json (2)** file and select **Open (3)**.

   ![image](../media/az104-43.png)

1. Then click on **Save**.

   >**Note:** Take a moment to review the template. We are deploying a virtual network and virtual machine so we can demonstrate backup and recovery. 

1. Select **Edit parameters**.
