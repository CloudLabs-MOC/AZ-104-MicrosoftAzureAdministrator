# AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator Workshop

### Overall Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you'll gain practical experience in setting up and managing Azure virtual networking. You will learn how to create a virtual network and subnets using both the Azure portal and a template, ensuring you can handle network configuration efficiently. Additionally, you'll configure security settings by linking an Application Security Group with a Network Security Group to control traffic and enhance security. Finally, youâ€™ll set up public and private DNS zones to manage domain name resolution. By the end of this lab, you'll be skilled in creating, configuring, and securing virtual networks, and managing DNS in Azure, equipping you with essential networking skills for your Azure environment.

## Objective

**Create a virtual network with subnets using the portal Objective**: Learn how to create a virtual network and its associated subnets using the Azure portal. This includes configuring the network address space and subnet details to organize and manage network resources effectively.

**Create a virtual network and subnets using a template Objective**: Understand how to use an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to deploy a virtual network and subnets. This task helps you automate network creation and ensures consistency in network configurations.

**Create and configure communication between an Application Security Group and a Network Security Group Objective**: Gain experience in setting up security rules to manage traffic between an Application Security Group (ASG) and a Network Security Group (NSG). This includes configuring inbound and outbound rules to control access and enhance network security.

**Configure public and private Azure DNS zones Objective**: Learn how to create and manage public and private DNS zones in Azure. This involves setting up DNS records for name resolution both within the virtual network and for external access, ensuring proper connectivity and domain name management.

## Pre-requisites

Fundamental knowledge in configuring and managing Azure virtual networks and DNS, including an understanding of network subnets, security groups, and DNS zones, essential for effective network management and security in Azure.

## Architecture

The architecture focuses on setting up and managing Azure virtual networks to ensure proper network segmentation and security. You start by creating a virtual network and subnets to organize network resources efficiently. The architecture includes configuring an Application Security Group (ASG) and a Network Security Group (NSG) to control traffic and enhance security between different network segments. Additionally, the setup involves configuring public and private DNS zones to handle domain name resolution for both internal and external access, ensuring reliable connectivity and proper management of network resources.

## Explanation of Components

**Microsoft Azure Virtual Network**: A foundational element of Azure that provides a secure and isolated network environment for your Azure resources. It enables you to define your own network address space and create subnets for organizing resources.

**Subnets**: Logical divisions within a virtual network that help in segmenting the network to improve management and security. Each subnet can host different types of resources and be assigned specific network security rules.

**Application Security Group (ASG)**: A feature that simplifies the management of network security policies by grouping virtual machines and other resources. It allows you to apply security rules to a group of resources rather than individually, making it easier to manage network traffic.

**Network Security Group (NSG)**: A network security feature that contains a list of security rules to control inbound and outbound network traffic to Azure resources. NSGs can be associated with subnets or individual network interfaces to enforce traffic control policies.

**Public DNS Zone**: A DNS zone in Azure that handles name resolution for domain names accessible from the internet. It allows you to manage DNS records, such as A records, to map domain names to IP addresses.

**Private DNS Zone**: A DNS zone in Azure used for name resolution within a virtual network. It ensures that DNS queries for internal domain names are resolved within the network, providing private name resolution for internal resources.


# Getting Started with the lab
