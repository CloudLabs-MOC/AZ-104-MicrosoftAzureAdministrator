# Lab Scenario Preview - 09 - Administer Serverless Computing

## Lab overview
+ You need to evaluate the use of Azure Web apps for hosting Contoso's websites, hosted currently in the company's on-premises data centers. The websites are running on Windows servers using PHP runtime stack. You also need to determine how you can implement DevOps practices by leveraging Azure web apps deployment slots.
+ Contoso wants to find a new platform for its virtualized workloads. You identified a number of container images that can be leveraged to accomplish this objective. Since you want to minimize container management, you plan to evaluate the use of Azure Container Instances for the deployment of Docker images.
+ Contoso also has a number of multi-tier applications that are not suitable to run by using Azure Container Instances. In order to determine whether they can be run as containerized workloads, you want to evaluate using Kubernetes as the container orchestrator. To further minimize management overhead, you want to test Azure Kubernetes Service, including its simplified deployment experience and scaling capabilities.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
+ Lab 9a - Implement Web Apps
   + Task 1: Create and configure an Azure web app.
   + Task 2: Create and configure a deployment slot.
   + Task 3: Configure web app deployment settings.
   + Task 4: Swap deployment slots.
   + Task 5: Configure and test autoscaling of the Azure web app.
   
+ Lab 9b - Implement Azure Container Instances
    + Task 1: Deploy an Azure Container Instance using a Docker image.
    + Task 2: Test and verify deployment of an Azure Container Instance.

+ Lab 9c - Implement Azure Kubernetes Service
    + Task 1: Create and configure an Azure Container App and environment.
    + Task 2: Test and verify deployment of the Azure Container App.
