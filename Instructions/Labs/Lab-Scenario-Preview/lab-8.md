# Lab Scenario Preview - 08 - Manage Virtual Machines

## Lab overview
You were tasked with identifying different options for deploying and configuring Azure virtual machines. First, you need to determine different compute and storage resiliency and scalability options you can implement when using Azure virtual machines. Next, you need to investigate compute and storage resiliency and scalability options that are available when using Azure virtual machine scale sets. You also want to explore the ability to automatically configure virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets by using the Azure Virtual Machine Custom Script extension.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
+ Task 1: Deploy zone-resilient Azure virtual machines by using the Azure portal.
+ Task 2: Manage compute and storage scaling for virtual machines.
+ Task 3: Create and configure Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.
+ Task 4: Scale Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.
+ Task 5: Create a virtual machine using Azure PowerShell (optional 1).
+ Task 6: Create a virtual machine using the CLI (optional 2).
