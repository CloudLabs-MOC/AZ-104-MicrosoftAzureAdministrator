# Lab 08 - Manage Virtual Machines

## Lab Overview

This lab focuses on deploying scalable and high-availability applications in Azure using Virtual Machines (VMs) and Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS).

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Deploy zone-resilient Azure virtual machines by using the Azure portal.
+ Task 2: Manage compute and storage scaling for virtual machines.
+ Task 3: Create and configure Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.
+ Task 4: Scale Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.
+ Task 5: Create a virtual machine using Azure PowerShell (optional 1).
+ Task 6: Create a virtual machine using the CLI (optional 2).

## Exercise 1: Manage Virtual Machines

In this exercise, you will manage Virtual Machines in Azure to deploy, configure, and maintain scalable and secure cloud-based infrastructure.

### Task 1: Deploy zone-resilient Azure virtual machines by using the Azure portal 

In this task, you will deploy two Azure virtual machines into different availability zones by using the Azure portal. Availability zones offer the highest level of uptime SLA for virtual machines at 99.99%. To achieve this SLA, you must deploy at least two virtual machines across different availability zones.

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Virtual machines (1)** and select **Virtual machines (2)**.

   ![](../Labs/Images/AZ104-1.png)

1. On the **Virtual machines** blade, click **+ Create (1)**, and then select in the drop-down **Azure virtual machine (2)**. Notice your other choices.

   ![](../Labs/Images/img1lab8.png)

1. On the **Basics** tab, in the **Availability zone** drop down menu, place a checkmark next to **Zone 2**. This should select both **Zone 1** and **Zone 2**.

    ![](../Labs/Images/l8i1.png)

   >**Note**: This will deploy two virtual machines in the selected region, one in each zone. You achieve the 99.99% uptime SLA because you have at least two VMs 
    distributed across at least two zones. In the scenario where you might only need one VM, it is a best practice to still deploy the VM to another zone.
     
1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create a virtual machine** blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |

## Task 2: Manage compute and storage scaling for virtual machines

In this task, you will scale a virtual machine by adjusting its size to a different SKU. Azure provides flexibility in VM size selection so that you can adjust a VM for periods of time if it needs more (or less) compute and memory allocated. This concept is extended to disks, where you can modify the performance of the disk, or increase the allocated capacity.

1. On the **az104-vm1** virtual machine, under **Availability + scale** blade, select **Size** (1). Search for size **DS1_v2** (2) and click on it then. Click **Resize** (3). When prompted, confirm the changes.

   ![](../Labs/Images/l8i4.png)

    >**Note**: Choose another size if **Standard DS1_v2** is not available. Resizing is also known as vertical , up or down.

1. Click on **Resize**.

   ![](../Labs/Images/az104-7.png)

1. Under **Settings** blade, select **Disks (1)**. Under **Data disks** select **+ Create and attach a new disk**.

   ![](../Labs/Images/az104-8.png)

1. Configure the settings (leave other settings at their default values) **(1)** and then click on **Apply (2)**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Disk name | `vm1-disk1` |
    | Storage type | **Standard HDD** |
    | Size (GiB) | `32` |

    ![image](../media/az104-9.png)

1. After the disk has been created, click **Detach** (if necessary, scroll to the right to view the detach icon).

   ![](../Labs/Images/az104-10.png)

     >**Note**: Detaching removes the disk from the VM but keeps it in storage for later use.

1. Then click **Apply**.     

1. In the azure portal, search and select `Disks`.

1. From the list of disks, search for **vm1-disk1 (1)** select the **vm1-disk1 (2)** object.

   ![](../Labs/Images/az104-11.png)

    >**Note:** The **Overview** blade also provides performance and usage information for the disk.

1. From the left navigation pane, Under the **Settings** blade, select **Size + performance (1)**. Set the storage type to **Standard SSD (2)**, and then click **Save (3)**.

   ![](../Labs/Images/az104-12.png)

1. Navigate back to the **az104-vm1** virtual machine and select **Disks (1)**.

    - In the **Data disk** section, select **Attach existing disks (2)**
    - Select **VM1-DISK1 (3)** in the **Disk name** drop-down
    - Verify the disk is now **Standard SSD (4)**
    - Select **Apply (5)** to save your changes

      ![](../Labs/Images/az104-13.png)

## Task 4: Scale Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets

In this task, you will scale the Virtual Machine (VM) Scale Set in Azure using a custom scale rule to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization based on specific criteria. A VM Scale Set allows you to manage a group of identical, load-balanced virtual machines that automatically scale in or out depending on the demand.

1. Select **Go to resource** or search and select the **vmss1** scale set.

1. Under **Availability + Scale** blade, click on **Scaling**.

   >**Did you know?** You can **Manual scale** or **Custom autoscale**. In scale sets with a small number of VM instances, increasing or decreasing the instance count (Manual scale) may be best. In scale sets with a large number of VM instances, scaling based on metrics (Custom autoscale) may be more appropriate.

 ### 4.1 Scale-out rule

1. Select **Custom autoscale** **(1)**. then change the **Scale mode** to **Scale based on metric (2)**. And then select **Add rule**.

   ![](../Labs/Images/l8i14.png) 

1. Let's create a rule that automatically increases the number of VM instances. This rule scales out when the average CPU load is greater than 70% over a 10-minute period. When the rule triggers, the number of VM instances is increased by 50% and then click on **Add (8)** to save the rule.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Metric source | **Current resource (vmss1)** |
    | Metric namespace | **Virtual Machine Host** |
    | Metric name | **Percentage CPU** (review your other choices) |

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Operator | **Greater than** (1) |
    | Metric threshold to trigger scale action | **70** (2) |
    | Duration (minutes) | **10** (3) |
    | Time grain statistic | **Average** (4) |
    | Operation | **Increase percent by** (review other choices) (5) |
    | Cool down (minutes) | **5** (6) |
    | Percentage | **50** (7) |
      
    ![](../Labs/Images/az104-22.png) 

1.  Be sure to Save your changes.

### 4.2 Scale in rule

1. During evenings or weekends, demand may decrease so it is important to create a scale in rule.

1. Let's create a rule that decreases the number of VM instances in a scale set. The number of instances should decrease when the average CPU load drops below 30% over a 10-minute period. When the rule triggers, the number of VM instances is decreased by 20%.

1. Select **Add a rule**, adjust the settings, then select **Add (5)**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Operator | **Less than** (1) |
    | Threshold | **30** (2) |
    | Operation | **decrease percentage by** (review your other choices) (3) |
    | Percentage | **20** (4) |

    ![](../Labs/Images/scalein-2002.png) 

1. Be sure to Save your changes.

### 4.3 Set the instance limits

1. When your autoscale rules are applied, instance limits make sure that you do not scale out beyond the maximum number of instances or scale in beyond the minimum number of instances.

1. **Instance limits** are shown on the **Scaling** page after the rules.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Minimum | **2** |
    | Maximum | **10** |
    | Default | **2** |

1. Be sure to **Save** your changes

1. On the **vmss1** page, select **Instances**. This is where you would monitor the number of virtual machine instances.

    ![](../Labs/Images/az104-24.png) 

    >**Note:** If you are interested in using Azure PowerShell for virtual machine creation, try Task 5. If you are interested in using the CLI to create virtual machines, try Task 6.

## Task 5: Create a virtual machine using Azure PowerShell (option 1)

1. On the Azure portal, select the **Cloud shell** (**[>_]**)  button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. This opens a cloud shell pane at the bottom of the portal.

   ![image](../media/az-104i10.png)

1. Run the following command to create a **virtual machine**. When prompted, provide a username and password for the VM. While you wait check out the [New-AzVM](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.compute/new-azvm?view=azps-11.1.0) command reference for all the parameters associated with creating a virtual machine.

    ```powershell
    New-AzVm `
    -ResourceGroupName 'az104-rg2' `
    -Name 'myPSVM' `
    -Location 'East US' `
    -Image 'Win2019Datacenter' `
    -Zone '1' `
    -Size 'Standard_D2s_v3'
    ```

     ![](../Labs/Images/az104-251.png)

      >**Note:** When prompted, please provide a Username as `TestUser` and Password as `Pa55w.rd!!` to create the new VM.

1. Once the command completes, use **Get-AzVM** to list the virtual machines in your resource group.

    ```powershell
    Get-AzVM `
    -ResourceGroupName 'az104-rg2' `
    -Status
    ```

     ![](../Labs/Images/az104-26.png)    

1. Verify your new virtual machine is listed and the **Status** is **Running**.

1. Use **Stop-AzVM** to deallocate your virtual machine. Type **Yes** to confirm.

    ```powershell
    Stop-AzVM `
    -ResourceGroupName 'az104-rg2' `
    -Name 'myPSVM' 
    ```

1. Use **Get-AzVM** with the **-Status** parameter to verify the machine is **deallocated**.

    >**Did you know?** When you use Azure to stop your virtual machine, the status is *deallocated*. This means that any non-static public IPs are released, and you stop paying for the VM’s compute costs.

## Task 6: Create a virtual machine using the CLI (option 2)

1. Click on  **Switch to Bash** to create a virtual machine using the CLI.

    ![](../Labs/Images/az104-27.png)

1. Run the following command to create a virtual machine. When prompted, provide a username and password for the VM. While you wait check out the [az vm create](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm?view=azure-cli-latest#az-vm-create) command reference for all the parameters associated with creating a virtual machine.

    ```sh
    az vm create --name myCLIVM --resource-group az104-rg2 --image Win2019Datacenter --admin-username localadmin --generate-ssh-keys
    ```

     ![](../Labs/Images/az104-28.png)

     >**Note**:Give Admin password as **Password.1!!** and Password will be not visible
   
1. Once the command completes, use **az vm show** to verify your machine was created.

    ```sh
    az vm show --name  myCLIVM --resource-group az104-rg2 --show-details
    ```

1. Verify the **powerState** is **VM Running**.

1. Use **az vm deallocate** to deallocate your virtual machine.

    ```sh
   az vm deallocate --resource-group az104-rg2 --name myCLIVM
    ```

1. Use **az vm show** to ensure the **powerState** is **VM deallocated**.

    ```sh
    az vm show --name  myCLIVM --resource-group az104-rg2 --show-details
    ```

  >**Did you know?** When you use Azure to stop your virtual machine, the status is *deallocated*. This means that any non-static public IPs are released, and you stop paying for the VM’s compute costs.
