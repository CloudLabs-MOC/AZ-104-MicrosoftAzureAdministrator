# Lab 02b - Manage Governance via Azure Policy

## Lab introduction

In this lab, you learn how to implement your organizationâ€™s governance plans. You learn how Azure policies can ensure operational decisions are enforced across the organization. You learn how to use resource tagging to improve reporting. 

## Lab scenario

Your organization's cloud footprint has grown considerably in the last year. During a recent audit, you discovered a substantial number of resources that do not have a defined owner, project, or cost center. In order to improve management of Azure resources in your organization, you decide to implement the following functionality:

- apply resource tags to attach important metadata to Azure resources

- enforce the use of resource tags for new resources by using Azure policy

- update existing resources with resource tags

- use resource locks to protect configured resources

## Interactive lab simulations

There are several interactive lab simulations that you might find useful for this topic. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required. 

+ [Manage resource locks](https://mslearn.cloudguides.com/en-us/guides/AZ-900%20Exam%20Guide%20-%20Azure%20Fundamentals%20Exercise%2015). Add a resource lock and test to confirm.
  
+ [Create an Azure policy](https://mslearn.cloudguides.com/en-us/guides/AZ-900%20Exam%20Guide%20-%20Azure%20Fundamentals%20Exercise%2017). Create an Azure policy that restricts the location resources can be located. Create a new resource and ensure the policy is enforced. 

+ [Manage governance via Azure policy](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-104%20Exam%20Guide%20-%20Microsoft%20Azure%20Administrator%20Exercise%203). Create and assign tags via the Azure portal. Create an Azure policy that requires tagging. Remediate non-compliant resources.


## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
+ Task 1: Create and assign tags via the Azure portal.
+ Task 2: Enforce tagging via an Azure Policy.

## Exercise 1

### Task 1: Assign tags via the Azure portal
In this task, you will create and assign a tag to an Azure resource group via the Azure portal.

1. On Azure Portal page, in **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)** box at the top of the portal, enter **Resource group**, and then select **Resource group** under services.

   ![image](./media/l2-image45.png)

1. On the resource group blade, click **Tags** and create a tag with the following settings and click on **Apply** to save your change:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | **Role** |
    | Value | **Infra** |

   ![image](./media/l2-image27.png)
   
### Task 2: Enforce tagging via an Azure policy
In this task, you will assign the built-in *Require a tag and its value on resources* policy to the resource group and evaluate the outcome. 

1. On Azure Portal page, in **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)** box at the top of the portal, enter **Policy**, and then select **Policy** under services.

   ![image](./media/l2-image28.png)

1. In the **Authoring** section, click **Definitions**. Take a moment to browse through the list of built-in policy definitions that are available for you to use. List all built-in policies that involve the use of tags by selecting the **Tags** entry (and de-selecting all other entries) in the **Category** drop-down list and click on **Apply**.

   ![image](./media/l2-image29.png)

1. In search bar enter **require** and click the entry representing the **Require a tag and its value on resources** built-in policy and review its definition.

    ![image](./media/l2-image30.png)
   
1. On the **Require a tag and its value on resources** built-in policy definition blade, click **Assign**.

    ![image](./media/l2-image31.png)

1. Specify the **Scope** by clicking the ellipsis button and selecting the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Resource Group | AZ-104T02 |

   ![image](./media/l2-image32.png)
   
   >**Note**: A scope determines the resources or resource groups where the policy assignment takes effect. You could assign policies on the management group, subscription, or resource group level. You also have the option of specifying exclusions, such as individual subscriptions, resource groups, or resources (depending on the assignment scope). 

1. Configure the **Basics** properties of the assignment by specifying the following settings anc click on **Next**  (leave others with their defaults):

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Assignment name | **Require Role tag with Infra value**|
    | Description | **Require Role tag with Infra value for all resources in the Cloud Shell resource group**|
    | Policy enforcement | Enabled |

    ![image](./media/l2-image33.png)
   
    >**Note**: The **Assignment name** is automatically populated with the policy name you selected, but you can change it. You can also add an optional **Description**. **Assigned by** is automatically populated based on the user name creating the assignment. 

1. Click **Next** and set **Parameters** to the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Tag Name | **Role** |
    | Tag Value | **Infra** |

   ![image](./media/l2-image34.png)
   
1. Click **Next** and review the **Remediation** tab. Leave the **Create a Managed Identity** checkbox unchecked. 

    >**Note**: This setting can be used when the policy or initiative includes the **deployIfNotExists** or **Modify** effect.

1. Click **Review + Create** and then click **Create**.

    >**Note**: Now you will verify that the new policy assignment is in effect by attempting to create another Azure Storage account in the resource group without explicitly adding the required tag. 
    
    >**Note**: It might take between 5 and 15 minutes for the policy to take effect.

1. Navigate back to the blade of the resource group hosting the storage account used for the Cloud Shell home drive, which you identified in the previous task.

1. On the resource group blade, click **+ Create** and then search for Storage Account, and click **+Create**. 

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create storage account** blade, verify that you are using the Resource Group that the Policy was applied to and specify the following settings (leave others with their defaults), click **Review + create** and then click **Create**:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Storage account name | storage<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> |

1. Once you create the deployment, you should see the **Validation failed. Required information is missing or not valid ** message.

    ![image](./media/l2-image35.png)

1. Verify whether the error message states that the resource deployment was disallowed by the policy by clicking **Previous** tag tab and select **Policy details** link to review the details.

   ![image](./media/l2-image36.png)

    >**Note**: You can find more details about the error, including the name of the role definition **Require Role tag with Infra value**. The deployment failed because the storage account you attempted to create did not have a tag named **Role** with its value set to **Infra**.

### Task 3: Apply tagging via an Azure policy
In this task, we will use a different policy definition to remediate any non-compliant resources. 

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Policy**. 

   ![image](./media/l2-image28.png)
   
1. In the **Authoring** section, click **Assignments**. 

1. In the list of assignments, right click the ellipsis icon in the row representing the **Require Role tag with Infra value** policy assignment and use the **Delete assignment** menu item to delete the assignment.

   ![image](./media/l2-image66.png)

1. Click **Assign policy** and specify the **Scope** by clicking the ellipsis button and selecting the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Resource Group | AZ-104T02 |

1. To specify the **Policy definition**, click the ellipsis button and then search for and select **Inherit a tag from the resource group if missing** then click on **Add**.

    ![image](./media/l2-image37.png)

    ![image](./media/l2-image38.png)

1. Configure the remaining **Basics** properties of the assignment by specifying the following settings (leave others with their defaults) and click on **Next**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Assignment name | **Inherit the Role tag and its Infra value from the Cloud Shell resource group if missing**|
    | Description | **Inherit the Role tag and its Infra value from the Cloud Shell resource group if missing**|
    | Policy enforcement | Enabled |

    ![image](./media/l2-image39.png)

1. Click **Next** and set **Parameters** to the following values:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Tag Name | **Role** |

    ![image](./media/l2-image40.png)
   
1. Click **Next** and, on the **Remediation** tab, configure the following settings (leave others with their defaults) and click **Review + Create**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Create a remediation task | enabled |
    | Policy to remediate | **Inherit a tag from the resource group if missing** |

    >**Note**: This policy definition includes the **Modify** effect.

    ![image](./media/l2-image41.png)
  
1. Click  **Create**.

    >**Note**: To verify that the new policy assignment is in effect, you will create another Azure Storage account in the same resource group without explicitly adding the required tag. 
    
    >**Note**: It might take between 5 and 15 minutes for the policy to take effect.

1. Navigate back to the blade of the resource group hosting the storage account used for the Cloud Shell home drive, which you identified in the first task.

1. On the resource group blade, click **+ Create** and then search for Storage Account, and click **+Create**. 

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create storage account** blade, verify that you are using the Resource Group that the Policy was applied to, and specify the following settings (leave others with their defaults) and click **Review + create**:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Resource Group | AZ-104T02 |
    | Storage account name |  **storage<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** |
    | Redundancy |  **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)** |

    ![image](./media/l2-image42.png)
   
1. Verify that this time the validation passed and click **Create**.

1. Once the new storage account is provisioned, click **Go to resource** button and, on the **Overview** blade of the newly created storage account, note that the tag **Role** with the value **Infra** has been automatically assigned to the resource.

   ![image](./media/l2-image43.png)

## Task 4: Configure and test resource locks

In this task, you configure and test a resource lock. Locks prevent either deletions or modifications of a resource. 

1. Search for and select your resource group **AZ-104T02**.
   
1. In the **Settings** blade, select **Locks**.

1. Select **+ Add** and complete the resource lock information. When finished select **Ok**. 

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Lock name | `rg-lock` |
    | Lock type | **delete** (notice the selection for read-only) |
    
1. Navigate to the resource group **Overview** blade, and select **Delete resource group**.

   ![image](./media/l2-image62.png)

1. In the **Enter resource group name to confirm deletion** textbox provide the resource group name, `AZ-104T02`. Notice you can copy and paste the resource group name and click on **Delete**. 

   ![image](./media/l2-image63.png)
   
1. You should receive a notification denying the deletion. 

    ![image](./media/l2-image64.png)

1. From the **AZ-104T02** resource group **Overview** blade, under **Settings** section select **Locks** and Select Locks and proceed to click **Delete** to remove the existing **rg-lock** locks.

- Enforce tagging via an Azure Policy.
- Apply tagging via an Azure Policy.
- Configure and test resource locks. 

## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 

+ Azure tags are metadata that consists of a key-value pair. Tags describe a particular resource in your environment. In particular, tagging in Azure enables you to label your resources in a logical manne.
+ Azure Policy establishes conventions for resources. Policy definitions describe resource compliance conditions and the effect to take if a condition is met. A condition compares a resource property field or a value to a required value. There are many built-in policy definitions and you can customize the policies. 
+ The Azure Policy remediation task feature is used to bring resources into compliance based on a definition and assignment. Resources that are non-compliant to a modify or deployIfNotExist definition assignment, can be brought into compliance using a remediation task.
+ You can configure a resource lock on a subscription, resource group, or resource. The lock can protect a resource from accidental user deletions and modifications. The lock overrides any user permissions.
+ Azure Policy is pre-deployment security practice. RBAC and resource locks are post-deployment security practice.
