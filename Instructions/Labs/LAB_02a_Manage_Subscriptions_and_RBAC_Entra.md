# Lab 02: Manage Subscriptions,RBAC and Governance

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will explore role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions and scopes, enabling precise control over actions that identities can perform. You will also simplify subscription management by organizing all Azure subscriptions under a management group and configuring permissions to allow virtual machine management and support request submissions.

## Interactive lab simulations

There are some interactive lab simulations that you might find useful for this topic. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required.

## Exercise 1: Manage Subscriptions and RBAC

In this exercise you will learn how to organize Azure subscriptions effectively and implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions and actions securely.

### Task 1: Implement Management Groups

In this task, you will create and organize management groups to streamline Azure subscription governance. This setup enables efficient policy enforcement and access management across your organization.

1. On the Azure portal, in **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)** box at the top of the portal search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

   ![image](./media/l2-image3.png) 
    
1.  On the blade displaying properties of your tenant, in the vertical menu on the left side, in the **Manage** section, select **Properties**.
  
    ![image](./media/lab02-new-1.png) 
    
1.  On the **Properties** blade of your tenant, in the **Access management for Azure resources** section, select **Yes** and then select **Save**.

    ![image](./media/l2-image5.png) 

1. On the Azure Portal page, in **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)** box at the top of the portal, enter **Management groups**, and then select **Management groups** under services.

    ![image](./media/l2-image1.png) 
    
     >**Note:** The Management Group page may take some-time to load. Please try to refresh the browser in the VM periodically until the Management group page loads.
  
1. On the **Management groups** blade, click **+ Create**.

1. On **Create a management** group blade specify the following settings and click **Submit**.

      | Setting | Value |
      | --- | --- |
      | Management group ID | **az104-02-mg1** |
      | Management group display name | **az104-02-mg1** |

      ![image](./media/l2-image7.png)

      > **Note:** If you get a message stating that the management group with this name already exists, you can cancel the creation of the management group and proceed further.
   
 1. On the **az104-02-mg1** blade, from the left navigation pane click **Subscriptions** and  click **+ Add Subscription**.
   
     ![image](./media/xxx1.png)
   
      >**Note:** If the subscription group is already present under the Management group you can proceed with the next task.

1. On the **Add subscription** blade, in the **Subscription** drop-down list, select the subscription you are using in this lab and click **Save**.
   
    ![image](./media/l2-image10.png)
   
1. On the **az104-02-mg1 \| Subscriptions** blade, refresh the page and  copy the ID of your Azure subscription into Clipboard. You will need it in the next task.
       
    ![image](./media/l2-image11.png)
   
## Task 2: Review and assign a built-in Azure role

In this task, you will review the built-in roles and assign the VM Contributor role to a member of the Help Desk. Azure provides a large number of [built-in roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles). 

1. Select the **az104-mg1** management group.

1. Select the **Access control (IAM)** blade (1), and then the **Roles** (2) tab.

    ![image](./media/az1.png)

1. Scroll through the built-in role definitions that are available. **View** a role to get detailed information about the **Permissions**, **JSON**, and **Assignments**. You will often use *owner*, *contributor*, and *reader*. 

1. Select **+ Add**, from the drop-down menu, select **Add role assignment**. 

1. On the **Add role assignment** blade, search for and select the **Virtual Machine Contributor**. The Virtual machine contributor role lets you manage virtual machines, but not access their operating system or manage the virtual network and storage account they are connected to. Select **Next**.

    >**Did you know?** Azure originally provided only the **Classic** deployment model. This has been replaced by the **Azure Resource Manager** deployment model. As a best practice, do not use classic resources. 

1. On the **Members** tab, select **+ Select members**.

1. Search for and select the  <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> user and click on **Select**. 

1. Click **Review + assign** twice to create the role assignment.

   >**Did you know?** This assignment might not actually grant you any additional privileges. If you already have the Owner role, that role includes all permissions associated with the VM Contributor role.
    
## Task 3: Create a custom RBAC role

In this task, you will create a custom RBAC role. Custom roles are a core part of implementing the principle of least privilege for an environment. Built-in roles might have too many permissions for your scenario. We will also create a new role and remove permissions that are not be necessary. Do you have a plan for managing overlapping permissions?

1. Continue working on your management group. In the **Access control (IAM)** blade, select **+ Add** and from the dropdown select  **Add custom role** box, select **Add**.

   ![image](./media/xxx2.png)

1. On the Basics tab specify the following configuration and select **Next**. 

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Custom role name | `Support Request Contributor(Custom)` |
    | Description | A custom contributor role for support requests. |
    | Baseline permissions | select **Clone a role**|
    | Role to clone drop-down menu | select **Support Request Contributor** |

     ![image](./media/l2-image44.png)

1. On **Permissions** tab, and then select **+ Exclude permissions**.

   ![image](./media/l2-image14.png)
   
1. In the resource provider search field, enter `.Support` and select **Microsoft.Support**.

   ![image](./media/l2-image15.png)

1. In the list of permissions, place a checkbox next to **Other: Registers Support Resource Provider** and then select **Add** and then click  **Next**. The role should be updated to include this permission as a *NotAction*.

    ![image](./media/l2-image16.png)
   
    >**Note:** An Azure resource provider is a set of REST operations that enable functionality for a specific Azure service. We do not want the Help Desk to be able to have this capability, so it is being removed from the cloned role. 

1. On the **Assignable scopes** tab, ensure your management group is listed, then click **Next**.

    ![image](./media/l2-image17.png)

1. Review the JSON for the *Actions*, *NotActions*, and *AssignableScopes* that are customized in the role.

   ![image](./media/l2-image18.png)

1. Select **Review + create**, and then select **Create**. Select **OK** when you see the pop up **You have successfully created the custom role "Custom Support Request". It may take the system a few minutes to display your role everywhere**. 

    >**Note:** At this point, you have created a custom role and assigned it to the management group. 

### Task 4: Assign RBAC roles

In this task, you will create a Microsoft Entra ID user, assign the RBAC role you created in the previous task to that user, and verify that the user can perform the task specified in the RBAC role definition.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Microsoft Entra ID**, click on **Users** under the **Manage** section of the left navigation pane. Click **+ New user** > **Create New User**.

   ![image](./media/l2-image19.png)
  
1. Create a new user with the following settings (leave others with their defaults) and click on **Review + create** (6)

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | User Principal name | **az104-02-aaduser1** (1)|
    | Display name | **az104-02-aaduser1** (2)|
    | Auto-generate password | unchecked (3) |
    | Password | **Provide a secure password** (4) |
    | Account enabled | **Checked** (5) |

    >**Note**: **Copy to clipboard** the full **User name**. You will need it later in this lab.

1. In the **InPrivate** browser window, on the **Problem Description** tab of the **Help + support - New support request** blade, **Service and subscription limits (quotas)** (1) as issue type is selected. Note that the subscription you are using in this lab is listed in the **Subscription** (2) drop-down list.
    
    ![image](./media/az3.1.png)

    >**Note**: The presence of the subscription you are using in this lab in the **Subscription** drop-down list indicates that the account you are using has the permissions required to create the subscription-specific support request.

    >**Note**: If you do not see the **Service and subscription limits (quotas)** option, sign out from the Azure portal and sign in back.

1. Do not continue with creating the support request. Instead, sign out as the az104-02-aaduser1 user from the Azure portal and close the InPrivate browser window.

## Task 5: Monitor role assignments with the Activity Log

In this task, you will review the Azure activity log to check for any actions indicating the creation of a new role. This helps ensure proper tracking and auditing of role-based changes within your Azure environment.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the Management group and and select **az104-02-mg1**. The activity log provides insight into subscription-level events. 

1. Select **Activity Log**  from the left navigation pane and click on **Quick Insights** from the list that appears and select **Role assignment**. The activity log can be filtered for specific operations and review the activites for role assignments.
