# Lab 06 - Implement Traffic Management
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You were tasked with testing managing network traffic targeting Azure virtual machines in the hub and spoke network topology, which Contoso considers implementing in its Azure environment (instead of creating the mesh topology, which you tested in the previous lab). This testing needs to include implementing connectivity between spokes by relying on user defined routes that force traffic to flow via the hub, as well as traffic distribution across virtual machines by using layer 4 and layer 7 load balancers. For this purpose, you intend to use Azure Load Balancer (layer 4) and Azure Application Gateway (layer 7).

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

+ Task 1: Provision the lab environment
+ Task 2: Configure the hub and spoke network topology
+ Task 3: Test transitivity of virtual network peering
+ Task 4: Configure routing in the hub and spoke topology
+ Task 5: Implement Azure Load Balancer
+ Task 6: Implement Azure Application Gateway

## Estimated timing: 60 minutes

## Instructions

### Exercise 1

#### Task 1: Provision the lab environment

In this task, you will deploy four virtual machines into the same Azure region. The first two will reside in a hub virtual network, while each of the remaining two will reside in a separate spoke virtual network.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. 

    >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell** and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and click **Show Advanced Settings**.

    ![](../media/lab6-1.png)

   * Resource group : Select **Use existing** -> **az104-06-rg1**
   * Storage account : Select **Create new** and Enter **cloudstore<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
   * File Share: Select **Create new** and Enter **none**

   > **Note :** Please wait until the storage account is created and proceed with next step.
   
1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, click the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu, click **Upload** and upload the files **C:\AllFiles\AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator-master\Allfiles\Labs\06\az104-06-vms-loop-template.json** and **C:\AllFiles\AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator-master\Allfiles\Labs\06\az104-06-vms-loop-parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the first resource group that will be hosting the lab environment:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzResourceGroup
   
   $rgName = 'az104-06-rg1'
   
   ```

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the three virtual networks and four Azure VMs into them by using the template and parameter files you uploaded:

   ```powershell
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
      -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
      -TemplateFile $HOME/az104-06-vms-loop-template.json `
      -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/az104-06-vms-loop-parameters.json
      
   ```

1. Enter any Password at the **adminPassword** prompt.

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding to the next step. This should take about 5 minutes.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to install the Network Watcher extension on the Azure VMs deployed in the previous step:

   ```powershell
   $location = (Get-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $rgName).location
   $vmNames = (Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName).Name

   foreach ($vmName in $vmNames) {
     Set-AzVMExtension `
     -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
     -Location $location `
     -VMName $vmName `
     -Name 'networkWatcherAgent' `
     -Publisher 'Microsoft.Azure.NetworkWatcher' `
     -Type 'NetworkWatcherAgentWindows' `
     -TypeHandlerVersion '1.4'
   }
   ```

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding to the next step. This should take about 5 minutes.

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Task 2: Configure the hub and spoke network topology

In this task, you will configure local peering between the virtual networks you deployed in the previous tasks in order to create a hub and spoke network topology.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Virtual networks**.

1. Review the virtual networks you created in the previous task.

    >**Note**: The template you used for the deployment of the three virtual networks ensures that the IP address ranges of the three virtual networks do not overlap.

1. In the list of virtual networks, select **az104-06-vnet2**.

1. On the **az104-06-vnet2** blade, select **Properties**. 

1. On the **az104-06-vnet2 \| Properties** blade, record the value of the **Resource ID** property.

1. Navigate back to the list of virtual networks and select **az104-06-vnet3**.

1. On the **az104-06-vnet3** blade, select **Properties**. 

1. On the **az104-06-vnet3 \| Properties** blade, record the value of the **Resource ID** property.

    >**Note**: You will need the values of the ResourceID property for both virtual networks later in this task.

    >**Note**: This is a workaround that addresses the issue with the Azure portal occasionally not displaying the newly provisioned virtual network when creating virtual network peerings.

1. In the list of virtual networks, click **az104-06-vnet01**.

1. On the **az104-06-vnet01** virtual network blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Peerings** and then click **+ Add**.

1. Add a peering with the following settings (leave others with their default values) and click Add:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | This virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-06-vnet01_to_az104-06-vnet2** |
    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None (default)** |
    | Remote virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-06-vnet2_to_az104-06-vnet01** |
    | Virtual network deployment model | **Resource manager** |
    | I know my resource ID | enabled |
    | Resource ID | the value of resourceID parameter of **az104-06-vnet2** you recorded earlier in this task |
    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None (default)** |

    >**Note**: Wait for the operation to complete.

    >**Note**: This step establishes two local peerings - one from az104-06-vnet01 to az104-06-vnet2 and the other from az104-06-vnet2 to az104-06-vnet01.

    >**Note**: **Allow forwarded traffic** needs to be enabled in order to facilitate routing between spoke virtual networks, which you will implement later in this lab.

1. On the **az104-06-vnet01** virtual network blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Peerings** and then click **+ Add**.

1. Add a peering with the following settings (leave others with their default values) and click Add:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | This virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-06-vnet01_to_az104-06-vnet3** |
    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None (default)** |
    | Remote virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-06-vnet3_to_az104-06-vnet01** |
    | Virtual network deployment model | **Resource manager** |
    | I know my resource ID | enabled |
    | Resource ID | the value of resourceID parameter of **az104-06-vnet3** you recorded earlier in this task |
    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Virtual network gateway | **None (default)** |

    >**Note**: This step establishes two local peerings - one from az104-06-vnet01 to az104-06-vnet3 and the other from az104-06-vnet3 to az104-06-vnet01. This completes setting up the hub and spoke topology (with two spoke virtual networks).

    >**Note**: **Allow forwarded traffic** needs to be enabled in order to facilitate routing between spoke virtual networks, which you will implement later in this lab.

1. Click **Next: Tags >**, followed by **Next: Review + create >** and then click **Create**.

    > **Note**: Wait for the Application Gateway instance to be created. This might take about 8 minutes.

1. In the Azure portal, search and select **Application Gateways** and, on the **Application Gateways** blade, click **az104-06-appgw5**.

1. On the **az104-06-appgw5** Application Gateway blade, note the value of the **Frontend public IP address**.

1. Start another browser window and navigate to the IP address you identified in the previous step.

1. Verify that the browser window displays the message **Hello World from az104-06-vm2** or **Hello World from az104-06-vm3**.

1. Open another browser window but this time by using InPrivate mode and verify whether the target vm changes (based on the message displayed on the web page).

    > **Note**: You might need to refresh the browser window or open it again by using InPrivate mode.

    > **Note**: Targeting virtual machines on multiple virtual networks is not a common configuration, but it is meant to illustrate the point that Application Gateway is capable of targeting virtual machines on multiple virtual networks (as well as endpoints in other Azure regions or even outside of Azure), unlike Azure Load Balancer, which load balances across virtual machines in the same virtual network.
