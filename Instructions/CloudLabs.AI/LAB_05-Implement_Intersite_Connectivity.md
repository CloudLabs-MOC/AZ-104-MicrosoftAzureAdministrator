# Lab 05 - Implement Intersite Connectivity
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

Contoso has its data centers in Boston, New York, and Seattle offices connected via mesh wide-area network links, with full connectivity between them. You need to implement a lab environment that will reflect the topology of Contoso's on-premises networks and verify its functionality.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

+ Task 1: Provision the lab environment
+ Task 2: Configure local and global virtual network peering
+ Task 3: Test intersite connectivity

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

### Instructions

#### Task 1: Provision the lab environment

In this task, you will deploy three virtual machines, each into a separate virtual network, with two of them in the same Azure region and the third one in another Azure region.

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. 

    >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell** and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and click **Show Advanced Settings**. 
    
    ![image](../media/cloudshell1.png)
    
    >Under **Advanced Settings**, you need to select an existing resource group from the **Resource group** dropdown and give some unique name under the **Storage Account** section, and under the **File share** section type none as shown in the below image.

1. Click **Create storage**, and wait until the Azure Cloud Shell pane is displayed. 

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, click the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu, click **Upload** and upload the files **C:\AllFiles\AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator-master\Allfiles\Labs\05\\az104-05-vnetvm-loop-template.json** and **C:\AllFiles\AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator-master\Allfiles\Labs\05\\az104-05-vnetvm-loop-parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.

1. Edit the **Parameters** file you just uploaded and change the password. If you need help editing the file in the Shell please ask your instructor for assistance. As a best practice, secrets, like passwords, should be more securely stored in the Key Vault.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to use the resource group that will be hosting the lab environment. The first two virtual networks and a pair of virtual machines will be deployed in `[Azure_region_1]`. The third virtual network and the third virtual machine will be deployed in the same resource group but another `[Azure_region_2]`. (replace the `[Azure_region_1]` and `[Azure_region_2]` placeholder, including the square brackets, with the names of two different Azure regions where you intend to deploy these Azure virtual machines). An example is $location1 = 'eastus'. You can use Get-AzLocation to list all locations.):

   ```powershell
   $location1 = '[Azure_region_1]'

   $location2 = '[Azure_region_2]'

   $rgName = 'az104-05-rg0-Deployment-id'
   ```

   >**Note**: In order to identify Azure regions, from a PowerShell session in Cloud Shell, run **(Get-AzLocation).Location**.
 
   >**Note**: Replace Deployment-id with **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.
   
   >**Note**: Provided resource group already exists. Are you sure you want to update it? type N .

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the three virtual networks and deploy virtual machines into them by using the template and parameter files you uploaded:

   ```powershell
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
      -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
      -TemplateFile $HOME/az104-05-vnetvm-loop-template.json `
      -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/az104-05-vnetvm-loop-parameters.json `
      -location1 $location1 `
      -location2 $location2
   ```

    **Note**: You will be prompted to provide an admin password. Enter your own Password or give **Pa55w.rd1234**
    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding to the next step. This should take about 2 minutes.

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Task 2: Configure local and global virtual network peering

In this task, you will configure local and global peering between the virtual networks you deployed in the previous tasks.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Virtual networks**.

1. Review the virtual networks you created in the previous task and verify that the first two are located in the same Azure region and the third one in a different Azure region.

    >**Note**: The template you used for the deployment of the three virtual networks ensures that the IP address ranges of the three virtual networks do not overlap.

1. In the list of virtual networks, click **az104-05-vnet0**.

1. On the **az104-05-vnet0** virtual network blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Peerings** and then click **+ Add**.

1. Add a peering with the following settings (leave others with their default values) and click **Add**:

    | Setting | Value|
    | --- | --- |
    | This virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-05-vnet0_to_az104-05-vnet1** |
    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway or Route Server | **None** |
    | Remote virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-05-vnet1_to_az104-05-vnet0** |
    | Virtual network deployment model | **Resource manager** |
    | I know my resource ID | unselected |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Virtual network | **az104-05-vnet1** |
    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway or Route Server | **None** |

    >**Note**: This step establishes two local peerings - one from az104-05-vnet0 to az104-05-vnet1 and the other from az104-05-vnet1 to az104-05-vnet0.

    >**Note**: In case you run into an issue with the Azure portal interface not displaying the virtual networks created in the previous task, you can configure peering by running the following PowerShell commands from Cloud Shell:
  
    >**Note**: Replace Deployment-id with **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.
    
   ```powershell
   $rgName = 'az104-05-rg0-Deployment-id'

   $vnet0 = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name 'az104-05-vnet0' -ResourceGroupName $rgname

   $vnet1 = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name 'az104-05-vnet1' -ResourceGroupName $rgname

   Add-AzVirtualNetworkPeering -Name 'az104-05-vnet0_to_az104-05-vnet1' -VirtualNetwork $vnet0 -RemoteVirtualNetworkId $vnet1.Id

   Add-AzVirtualNetworkPeering -Name 'az104-05-vnet1_to_az104-05-vnet0' -VirtualNetwork $vnet1 -RemoteVirtualNetworkId $vnet0.Id
   ``` 

1. On the **az104-05-vnet0** virtual network blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Peerings** and then click **+ Add**.

1. Add a peering with the following settings (leave others with their default values) and click **Add**:

    | Setting | Value|

    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway or Route Server | **None** |
    | Remote virtual network: Peering link name | **az104-05-vnet2_to_az104-05-vnet0** |
    | Virtual network deployment model | **Resource manager** |
    | I know my resource ID | unselected |
    | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
    | Virtual network | **az104-05-vnet2** |
    | Traffic to remote virtual network | **Allow (default)** |
    | Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network | **Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network** |
    | Virtual network gateway or Route Server | **None** |

    >**Note**: This step establishes two global peerings - one from az104-05-vnet0 to az104-05-vnet2 and the other from az104-05-vnet2 to az104-05-vnet0.

    >**Note**: In case you run into an issue with the Azure portal interface not displaying the virtual networks created in the previous task, you can configure peering by running the following PowerShell commands from Cloud Shell:
   
   >**Note**: Replace Deployment-id with **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.
    
   ```powershell
   $rgName = 'az104-05-rg0-Deployment-id'

   $vnet0 = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name 'az104-05-vnet0' -ResourceGroupName $rgname

   $vnet2 = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name 'az104-05-vnet2' -ResourceGroupName $rgname

   Add-AzVirtualNetworkPeering -Name 'az104-05-vnet0_to_az104-05-vnet2' -VirtualNetwork $vnet0 -RemoteVirtualNetworkId $vnet2.Id

   Add-AzVirtualNetworkPeering -Name 'az104-05-vnet2_to_az104-05-vnet0' -VirtualNetwork $vnet2 -RemoteVirtualNetworkId $vnet0.Id
   ``` 

1. Navigate back to the **Virtual networks** blade and, in the list of virtual networks, click **az104-05-vnet1**.
