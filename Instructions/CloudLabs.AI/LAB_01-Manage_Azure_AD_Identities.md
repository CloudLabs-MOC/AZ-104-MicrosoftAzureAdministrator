# Lab 01 - Manage Azure Active Directory Identities

## Lab scenario
To allow Contoso users to authenticate by using Azure AD, you have been tasked with provisioning users and group accounts. Membership of the groups should be updated automatically based on the user's job titles. You also need to create a test Azure AD tenant with a test user account and grant that account limited permissions to resources in the Contoso Azure subscription.

## Objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create and configure Azure AD users
+ Task 2: Create Azure AD groups with assigned and dynamic membership
+ Task 3: Create an Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant
+ Task 4: Manage Azure AD guest users

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Exercise 1

### Task 1: Create and configure Azure AD users
In this task, you will create and configure Azure AD users.

1. In the Azure portal, search for Azure Active Directory (1) and select **Azure Active Directory (2)**.

1. On the Azure Active Directory blade, in the **Manage** section, click **Users**.

    ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/users.png)

1. Click your user account to display its **Profile** settings. 

     ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/odluser.png)

1. Click **Edit properties**, set **Usage location** to **United States**, and click **Save** to apply the change.

     ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/editpro.png)

    >**Note**: This is necessary in order to assign an Azure AD Premium P2 license to your user account later in this lab.
  
1. Navigate back to the **Users - All users** blade, and then click **+ New user (1)** then select **+ Create new user (2)**.

     ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/newuser.png)

1. Create a new user on the **Basics (1)** tab with the following settings (leave others with their defaults) and select **Next: properties (6) >**

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | User principal name | **az104-01a-aaduser1 (2)**  |
    | Display Name | **az104-01a-aaduser1 (3)** |
    | Auto-generate password | unchecked **(4)** |
    | Password | **Provide a secure password (5)** |
    | Account enabled | **Checked (7)** |
    
      >**Note**: **Copy to clipboard** the full **User Principal Name** (user name plus domain) and record the password. You will need it later in this task.
    
      ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/aad1.1.png)
    
 1. On  the **Properties** tab specify the following settings (leave others with their defaults)   

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Job title  | **Cloud Administrator** |
    | Department | **IT** |
    | Usage location | **United States** |
    
      ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/aad11.png)
     
      ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/location.png)
    
1. Click on **Review + create** and then **Create**.

1. In the list of users, click the newly created user account to display its blade.

1. Review the options available in the **Manage** section and note that you can identify the Azure AD roles assigned to the user account as well as the user account's permissions to Azure resources.

1. In the **Manage** section, click **Assigned roles**.

     ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/assignrole.png)

1.  Then click **+ Add assignment** button and assign the **User administrator** role to **az104-01a-aaduser1**.

    >**Note**: You also have the option of assigning Azure AD roles when provisioning a new user.

      ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/az-104-ex-1-task-1-st-16.png)
     
1. Open an **InPrivate** browser window and sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using the newly created user account. When prompted to update the password, change the password to a secure password of your choosing. 

    >**Note**: Rather than typing the user name (including the domain name), you can paste the content of Clipboard.

1. In the Settings tab, leave everything to default and click on **Assign**.    

1. In the **InPrivate** browser window, in the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.

      ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/aad01.png)
      
    >**Note**: While this user account can access the Azure Active Directory tenant, it does not have any access to Azure resources. This is expected since such access would need to be granted explicitly by using Azure Role-Based Access Control. 

1. In the **InPrivate** browser window, on the Azure AD blade, scroll down to the **Manage** section, click **User settings**, note that you do not have permission to modify any configuration options, and sign out of the user account **az104-01a-aaduser1** and close the InPrivate window.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Active Directory**, in the **Manage** section, click **Users**, then click **+ New user** then select **+ Create new user**.

     ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/newuser.png)

1. Create a new user on the **Basics** tab with the following settings (leave others with their defaults) and select **Next: properties>**

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | User principal name | **az104-01a-aaduser2** |
    | Display Name | **az104-01a-aaduser2** |
    | Auto-generate password | unchecked |
    | Password | **Provide a secure password** |
    | Account enabled | **Checked** |
    
     >**Note**: **Copy to clipboard** the full **User Principal Name** (user name plus domain) and record the password. You will need it later in this task.
    
 1. on **Properties** tab specify the following settings (leave others with their defaults) 
    
    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Job title | **System Administrator** |
    | Department | **IT** |
    | Usage location | **United States** |
    
1. Click on **Review + create** and then **Create**.

1. Sign out as the az104-01a-aaduser1 user from the Azure portal and close the InPrivate browser window.

    >**Note**: If the users are already created then you can skip this task and continue further. 

### Task 2: Create Azure AD groups with assigned and dynamic membership
In this task, you will create Azure Active Directory groups with assigned and dynamic membership.

1. Back in the Azure portal where you are signed in with your **user account**, navigate back to the **Overview** blade of the Azure AD tenant and, in the **Manage** section, click **Licenses**.

      ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/lic.png)    

    >**Note**: Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 licenses are required in order to implement dynamic groups.

1. In the **Manage** section, click **All products**. Verify **Azure AD Premium P2** is already added to the list of licenses, if it is added then skip the next two steps and continue.

1. Click **+ Try/Buy** and activate the free trial of Azure AD Premium P2.

      ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/trybuy.png)    

1. Refresh the browser window to verify that the activation was successful. 

    >**Note**: It can take up to 10 minutes for the licenses to activate. Continue refreshing the page until it appears. Do not proceed until the licenses have been activated.

     ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/AADP2.png)    

1. Click on **+ Assign**.

1. On the Assign license page click on **+ Add Users and Groups** and assign all license options of Azure AD Premium P2 to your user account and the two newly created user accounts.

   ![](../CloudLabs.AI/Images/az-104-ex-1-task-2-st-7.png)     
   
1. Click on **Review + assign** and **Assign**.
