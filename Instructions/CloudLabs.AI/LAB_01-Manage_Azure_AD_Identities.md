## Lab 01 - Manage Azure Active Directory Identities

# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

In order to allow Contoso users to authenticate by using Azure AD, you have been tasked with provisioning users and group accounts. Membership of the groups should be updated automatically based on the user job titles. You also need to create a test Azure AD tenant with a test user account and grant that account limited permissions to resources in the Contoso Azure subscription.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

+ Task 1: Create and configure Azure AD users
+ Task 2: Create Azure AD groups with assigned and dynamic membership
+ Task 3: Create an Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant
+ Task 4: Manage Azure AD guest users 

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Instructions

### Exercise 1

#### Task 1: Create and configure Azure AD users

In this task, you will create and configure Azure AD users.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.

1. On the Azure Active Directory blade, scroll down to the **Manage** section, click **User settings**, and review available configuration options.

1. On the Azure Active Directory blade, in the **Manage** section, click **Users**, and then click your user account to display its **Profile** settings. 

1. Click **Edit properties**, set **Usage location** to **United States**, and click **save** to apply the change.

    >**Note**: This is necessary in order to assign an Azure AD Premium P2 license to your user account later in this lab.

1. Navigate back to the **Users - All users** blade, and then click **+ New user** then select **+ Create new user**.

1. Create a new user with the following settings (leave others with their defaults):

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | User name | **az104-01a-aaduser1** |
    | Name | **az104-01a-aaduser1** |
    | Let me create the password | enabled |
    | Initial password | **Provide a secure password** |
    | Usage location | **United States** |
    | Job title | **Cloud Administrator** |
    | Department | **IT** |

    >**Note**: **Copy to clipboard** the full **User Principal Name** (user name plus domain). You will need it later in this task.
1. Click on **Create**.
1. In the list of users, click the newly created user account to display its blade.

1. Review the options available in the **Manage** section and note that you can identify the Azure AD roles assigned to the user account as well as the user account's permissions to Azure resources.

1. In the **Manage** section, click **Assigned roles**, then click **+ Add assignment** button and assign the **User administrator** role to **az104-01a-aaduser1** and under Setting selct assignment type as **Active**, enter **User** in justification and click on **Assign**.

    >**Note**: You also have the option of assigning Azure AD roles when provisioning a new user.

1. Open an **InPrivate** browser window and sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using the newly created user account. When prompted to update the password, change the password to a secure password of your choosing. 

    >**Note**: Rather than typing the user name (including the domain name), you can paste the content of Clipboard.

1. In the **InPrivate** browser window, in the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.

    >**Note**: While this user account can access the Azure Active Directory tenant, it does not have any access to Azure resources. This is expected since such access would need to be granted explicitly by using Azure Role-Based Access Control. 

1. In the **InPrivate** browser window, on the Azure AD blade, scroll down to the **Manage** section, click **User settings**, and note that you do not have permission to modify any configuration options, and signout the user account **az104-01a-aaduser1** and close the Inprivate window.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Active Directory**, in the **Manage** section, click **Users**, and then click **+ New user** then select **+ Create new user**.

1. Create a new user with the following settings (leave others with their defaults):

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | User name | **az104-01a-aaduser2** |
    | Name | **az104-01a-aaduser2** |
    | Let me create the password | enabled |
    | Initial password | **Provide a secure password** |
    | Usage location | **United States** |
    | Job title | **System Administrator** |
    | Department | **IT** |

1. Sign out as the az104-01a-aaduser1 user from the Azure portal and close the InPrivate browser window.

    >**Note**: If the users are already created then you can skip this task and continue further. 

#### Task 2: Create Azure AD groups with assigned and dynamic membership

In this task, you will create Azure Active Directory groups with assigned and dynamic membership.

1. Back in the Azure portal where you are signed in with your **user account**, navigate back to the **Overview** blade of the Azure AD tenant and, in the **Manage** section, click **Licenses**.

    >**Note**: Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 licenses are required in order to implement dynamic groups.

1. In the **Manage** section, click **All products**. Verify **Azure AD Premium P2** is already added to the list of licenses, if it is added then skip next two steps and continue.

1. Click **+ Try/Buy** and activate the free trial of Azure AD Premium P2.

1. Refresh the browser window to verify that the activation was successful. 

1. From the **Licenses - All products** blade, select the **Azure Active Directory Premium P2** entry.

1. Click on **+ Assign**.

1. On Assign license page click on **+ Add Users and groups** and assign all license options of Azure AD Premium P2 to your user account and the two newly created user accounts.

    | Group description | **Contoso IT cloud administrators** |
    | Membership type | **Dynamic User** |

    >**Note**: If the **Membership type** drop-down list is grayed out, wait a few minutes and refresh the browser page.

1. Click **Add dynamic query**.

1. On the **Configure Rules** tab of the **Dynamic membership rules** blade, create a new rule with the following settings:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Property | **jobTitle** |
    | Operator | **Equals** |
    | Value | **Cloud Administrator** |

1. Save the rule and, back on the **New Group** blade, click **Create**. 

1. Back on the **Groups - All groups** blade of the Azure AD tenant, click the **+ New group** button and create a new group with the following settings:

    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Group type | **Security** |
    | Group name | **IT System Administrators** |
    | Group description | **Contoso IT system administrators** |
    | Membership type | **Dynamic User** |

1. Click **Add dynamic query**.

1. On the **Configure Rules** tab of the **Dynamic membership rules** blade, create a new rule with the following settings:

    | Group description | **Contoso IT Lab administrators** |
    | Membership type | **Assigned** |

1. Click **No members selected**.

1. From the **Add members** blade, search and select the **IT Cloud Administrators** and **IT System Administrators** groups and, back on the **New Group** blade, click **Create**.

1. Back on the **Groups - All groups** blade, click the entry representing the **IT Cloud Administrators** group and, then display its **Members** blade. Verify that the **az104-01a-aaduser1** appears in the list of group members.

    >**Note**: You might experience delays with updates of the dynamic membership groups. To expedite the update, navigate to the group blade, display its **Dynamic membership rules** blade, **Edit** the rule listed in the **Rule syntax** textbox by adding a whitespace at the end, and **Save** the change.

1. Navigate back to the **Groups - All groups** blade, click the entry representing the **IT System Administrators** group and, then display its **Members** blade. Verify that the **az104-01a-aaduser2** appears in the list of group members.
