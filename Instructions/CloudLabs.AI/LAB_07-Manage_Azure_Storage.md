# Lab 07 - Manage Azure Storage
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

You need to evaluate the use of Azure storage for storing files residing currently in on-premises data stores. While the majority of these files are not accessed frequently, there are some exceptions. You would like to minimize the cost of storage by placing less frequently accessed files in lower-priced storage tiers. You also plan to explore different protection mechanisms that Azure Storage offers, including network access, authentication, authorization, and replication. Finally, you want to determine to what extent Azure Files service might be suitable for hosting your on-premises file shares.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

+ Task 1: Provision the lab environment
+ Task 2: Create and configure Azure Storage accounts
+ Task 3: Manage blob storage
+ Task 4: Manage authentication and authorization for Azure Storage
+ Task 5: Create and configure an Azure Files shares
+ Task 6: Manage network access for Azure Storage

## Estimated timing: 40 minutes

## Instructions

### Exercise 1

#### Task 1: Provision the lab environment

In this task, you will deploy an Azure virtual machine that you will use later in this lab.

1. If you have not yet signed in, please navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**.

In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, click the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu, click **Upload** and upload the files **C:\AllFiles\AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator-master\Allfiles\Labs\07\az104-07-vm-template.json** and **C:\AllFiles\AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator-master\Allfiles\Labs\07\\az104-07-vm-parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the virtual machine (replace the `[Azure_region]` placeholder with the name of an Azure region same as the  Resource group region of az104-07-rg0.

    >**Note**: To list the names of Azure regions, run `(Get-AzLocation).Location`. 

   ```powershell
   $location = '[Azure_region]'

   $rgName = 'az104-07-rg0'
   
   ```
1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to deploy the virtual machine by using the uploaded template and parameter files:

    >**Note**: You will be prompted to provide an Admin password. Please enter a valid password within the powershell pane and hit enter.

   ```powershell
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
      -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
      -TemplateFile $HOME/az104-07-vm-template.json `
      -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/az104-07-vm-parameters.json `
      -AsJob
   ```

    >**Note**: Do not wait for the deployments to complete, but proceed to the next task.
